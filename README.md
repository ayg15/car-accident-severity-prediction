# Car Accidents Analysis & Severity Prediction

Accidents are a major cause of traffic congestion and identifying where and why the number of accidents is higher and why there are more severe accidents helps in taking precautionary steps in better traffic management and this eventually helps in reducing the number of accidents. 

The aim of this project is to predict the severity class of the car accident based on various environmental factors, location and traffic conditions. The severity prediction can help improve the traffic safety and also can help to understand the reason for the accidents.

The dataset used here is a [US Accident Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents) from Kaggle. This dataset covers car accidents records from 49 US states with the data collected between February 2016 to December 2020..
